"gsk","A pragmatic company with great values and plenty of common sense","Former Employee - Safety Evaluation & Risk Management","Uxbridge, England","Recommends","Neutral Outlook","No Opinion of CEO","I worked at GlaxoSmithKline full-time for more than 3 years","Having been with a different employer in the same sector for a number of years, I now feel that I am in a position to write an objective review of my time at GSK. As different teams at the same company can have very different dynamics and styles of management, these experiences may or may not be applicable to other teams at GSK - I write only based on my own experiences.

Pros:

1) Logical processes and organisational structures. I disgaree with some of the other reviews that claim that GSK has layers of unnecessary processes. This is a highly regulated industry and robust processes are an absolute (and legal) must. Compared to every other company I have worked for, I found the processes at GSK were highly logical, full of common sense, devoid of unnecessary complexity and only involved the people that actually needed to be involved. I found the organisational structures to be similarly logical and, unlike some other companies, I could easily the purpose of every role.

2) Innovation and improvement was encouraged. I found my suggestions for improvements were always taken on board and I was encouraged to pursue my ideas. This is in contrast to other major companies I have worked for where a suggestion backed by a careful, logical argument of why it would be beneficial to the business will simply be ignored by management with no rational reason given.

3) High integrity. Although GSK did suffer some unfortunate incidents, I never found any lack of integrity amongst my colleagues and was certainly never put in a position where I had to compromise my values.

4) Genuine empowerment. I never experienced any micromanagement and was trusted to take decisions independently.

Overall, GSK continues to exceed all of the other companies I have worked for in the above areas.","Despite my many positive experiences at GSK, I did decide to leave the company (reluctantly, but I believe it was for the best). This was due to the reasons which I have summarised below:

1) Very limited opportunities to develop in line with one's own ambitions. In my current company, my manager makes a great deal of effort to give me work which I find interesting and which allows me to develop the skills I need to achieve my career ambitions. At GSK, I felt that I was simply allocated whatever tasks 'needed doing' at the time, with very little thought or concern given to whether it was relevant to my aspirations at the company. I also found that management were very reluctant to let people explore opportunities elsewhere, be it in other teams in the same department or elsewhere in GSK. I found there to be an overriding emphasis on team retention to the point where managers appeared visibly uncomfortable if the subject of pursuing an opportunity in another team was raised. 

2) Some managers were reluctant communicators. Rather than managers taking the time to develop an open, honest and trusting relationship with their team members, I found that they frequently preferred to make assumptions about people and were often very reluctant to discuss changes or issues happening in the department. Decisions might be taken about your development 'in secret' without giving you the opportunity to voice your opinion. This is in contrast to my current manager who I enjoy a very open and trusting relationship with.

3) Very different expectations of team members. I found that the team relied heavily on a particular subset of individuals to complete the bulk of the work, especially when it came to non-routine and more complex tasks. Management appeared to have very different expectations of different team members, even those at the same grade. Some individuals would be given a limited workload of routine tasks and allowed to work at a slow pace, while others would be given crushing workloads and expected to deliver quickly. It appeared that excuses such as 'I don't have the right skills for this' would result in the task simply being reallocated to someone else, often a person who already had a high workload. Some individuals expect to be 'spoon fed' everything and do not make the effort to proactively learn new skills.

4) Office environment and locations. The office I worked in did not feel like those of the prestiguous international company that GSK is. It was very dated with stained carpets, dingy lighting and a generally downbeat atmosphere. Additionally, the Brentford, Weybridge and Uxbridge offices in particular are situated in areas with a very high cost of living and there was not a consistent policy on working from home. This is biased against individuals from a poorer background who cannot afford the affluent lifestyles in these areas which some of the older or more middle-class employees can.","None",4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"Sun Sep 01 2019 06:23:39 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"

Patient focus though discussed is not really our driving force and the production staff to team leader level are largely disregarded and disrespected. 
       Management dither aimlessly on decisions that they seem inexperienced and ill equipped to make and they lack all of the necessary human skills to run an efficient, effective, harmonious business... 
       The company bleeds money on irrelevant projects while live production lines and staff are largely unsupported and left to make do with outdated equipment, insufficient staff numbers and extremely limited training given the importance of our products. Decisions are often made that have devastating impacts on the personal lives of employees but little regard, remorse or flexibility is shown in trying to make transitions smooth. We are frequently lied to, bullied and generally abused by our over stressed team leaders, one of whom has been solely responsible for at least five employees leaving the company abruptly but has never been scrutinised for his actions. 75%+ of the production team in my department are desperate for redundancy and long to leave this company at the first opportunity.
      I personally have been tortured by the company who chose to leave me on a production line for several months despite it causing me serious pain due to a previous back injury which was being massively aggravated by the ergonomics of the line, I was called a liar when I tried to confront the problem and am still living with the damage months later, additionally I have one of the most severe levels of depression a person can get which I have do deal with alone day in day out, year in year out, when I made GSK aware of this I was subsequently black-marked as a result, duty of care was not even considered and my situation has got much worse, life threatening in fact, as a result of GSK's interference into my personal life... oh... and they made me take a weeks holiday to attend my dying fathers bedside some years back!
           If you are looking for a corporate management position then this could be the place for you but as a production employee responsible for manufacturing a life saving product administered to millions of people all over the world I am hugely disappointed by the company that I no longer trust or respect.

Lack of communication and collaboration between management, production, planning and maintenance. My department was understaffed and required over time every weekend( although not mandatory). There was talk of going to a 12 hour shift schedule the whole time I was in the department but it always fell through due to staffing issues and not having everyone on board. Newer employees were always in the shadows of senior techs/ favorites  in management's eyes even if performance level was equal or better. No recognition for going above and beyond, the job can be very stressful depending on where your shift starts during the production process with no support and sometimes not having the right tools or the right people/resources to do the job correctly and efficiently. Equipment would break down with repetitive problems, no fix from engineering or maintenance. It was always a temporary band-aid repair or nothing causing it to just happen the next night or next week exc. Inappropriate relationships between supervisors and coworkers. The training program is flawed and almost non existent.

While I was only at GSK for a few years and did have a PT position, I saw a number of examples of FT, longtime employees getting opportunities to spend six months in a different department, job-share, get training, etc.  Benefits were also great.","As a newcomer to the company working many (great) people who had been there for decades, I found that it could sometimes be difficult to break into the 'inner circle' and be included in certain projects. I brought a lot of good, relevant experience into the department, but I had to keep reminding them that I was happy to help and had some expertise with certain kinds of projects. As a PT person, I knew some of that was just a given, but it was also a shame to be under-utliized sometimes. At the end of my time there, we shifted to open workspace and 'hoteling' -- where you never sit in the same place every day and keep your belongings in a file drawer. I saw few benefits - it was a drag to have no bit of real estate to call your own and put personal touches on, and my team was less connected instead of more, simply because we no longer sat together. Everyone was far-flung.","None",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,"Mon Oct 01 2018 14:13:40 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"

Not all elements of report are always investigated- may be related to understanding of nuances. 
Some reports are not investigated eg harrassment cases the victim is asked if they wish for an investigation putting them in a vulnerable position as by default it’s not an anonymous investigation. (Not only example I have heard of)
Gaps identified are not all followed up to check they are closed.

The team running the ESPRIT program does not communicate well the vision and goal well to senior leaders, leading to confusion about the differences between post-MBA and post-BA graduates.

The people you work with are exceptional and the culture has been historically supportive, encouraging, positive, and focused on development.  The company has a true sense of mission and a strong teamwork approach.  Compensation and benefits are without question exceptional as is the work life balance.  During recent savings initiatives the travel budget was cut substantially year on year for the past 5 years.  While this might seem like a negative it was in fact a very large positive having shown that most business travel can be cut without negative impacts on performance.  Judicious investments in video teleconferencing and collaboration tools more than made up for the travel reductions and sharply improved work life balance for all corporate travelers especially where US/Europe and US/Asia travel was concerned.","Recent changes to the corporate strategy, integration of the Novartis business/joint venture, and a strong move to downsize has undercut the culture and resources that made it a truly great place to work.  Many highly experienced individuals elected to leave the company due to these changes.  This, along with a very challenging computer system upgrade has made life more difficult for employees.  Hopefully these just turn out to be growing pains.  The real negative has become the strong growth of corporate politics between the former GSK and Novartis factions.  Politicization and siloing has pushed decision making on even the most mundane of subjects to much too high of a level.  This coupled with business performance objectives that are divorced from what is actually feasible have contributed to distress at manager level and below.","None",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,"Fri Apr 21 2017 11:27:28 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"

- Senior leaders does not practice coaching and mentoring. They will only give a beautiful speech about 'Your career is in your own hands. Come to us for advice and we will help you grow'. However, that does not translate into reality when subordinates actually ask for guidance and are often brushed off (All talk but no walk).

- The political game is high on red alert where top level management brings the political game down to lower subordinate levels to stir up dissatisfaction and unhealthy competition.

- Slow/no career progression even though you are a strong candidate (unless you are able to speak the same language as certain senior managers then you will progress at the speed of light).

- Promotion of talent is often not in the books. It is often hired externally to fill up the ranks causing the company to lose its originality.

- Senior management does not practice transparency; which does not come as a surprise as most company does not disclose PnC information.

You are treated as if you are a child and while the rest of the departments enjoy work from home days, you are stuck at the office because direct management wants to monitor your every move. (Even though they record every single call) it is required that you record every call in 3 different systems and treat employees as if they are incompetent. The accounts the inside reps are given are absolutely terrible and most of the time you are just wishing you had something to do that way you are not reprimanded.

"gsk","Your mileage may vary","Former Employee - Anonymous Employee","None","Doesn't Recommend","Neutral Outlook","No Opinion of CEO","I worked at GlaxoSmithKline full-time for more than 3 years","In my experience, the level of comfort is good. I mean the package was pretty alright considering flexibility with office hours and good benefits. 

Stated values are good, and this still attracts smart well-meaning people. I can see how that appeals to recent grads. 

The company is also trying to institutionalise some good project management practices and a coherent manufacturing system.","The place is just inconsistent: if you're lucky with a good manager who genuinely subscribes to the values, it can be a wonderful gig. Unfortunately, there are too many skillful navigators at director/vp level and above, who are proper bullies and/or just poor leaders. And despite all the talk of values and despite the restructurings, they still poison the place. More specific observations:

1) Bloated org structure at regional offices. We usually cut headcount at middle management or below, with senior management layers only getting reshuffled. E.g. a senior marketer's job is cut, and the team is disbanded. However the sr manager will call a few buddies and get a random newly-created senior position. The new position will then sprout new positions around it because 'there is so much work to do'. And then the next restructuring comes, with new job titles and the cycle repeats, but operational efficiency remains poor, because there are too many chiefs with overlapping jobs in proportion to the people at execution level. 

2) Related to the first one: poor accountability, because the matrix structures are ridiculous. It's always a decision by committee, and then it's no one's fault if things go south. Decision speed suffers because of the matrix as well - I've seen senior leaders go and ask their bosses to approve mundane decisions which are clearly in their mandate.

3) A good chunk of the system infrastructure is disjointed / archaic. Upgrade projects are under way, but dates are regularly getting pushed back. Seriously, it's 2015, and here is a major mnc where we still collect data via custom spreadsheets for generic analyses. 

4) There is a lot of pressure from the top to reach targets which drives a lot of dubious behaviours with insecure leaders: massaging results, contentious marketing practices... Executive management cannot legitimately claim we are serious about values when we've had bad news from 6-8 different countries in the past 2 years. Hopefully the digital push will help... Consumer healthcare is also bad - the president is a very aggressive individual who says the right things in public but she sets the wrong examples in front of smaller audiences.","None",2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,"Fri Dec 11 2015 05:28:32 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)"

Company generally seems committed to safety.  Company tries to keep employees informed.","If you are an older, non-management employee, lower level supervisors try to drive you down and out of the company.  If you file a complaint against a supervisor, they will find a way to drive you to quit.  Five (5) months after I resigned, GSK is demanding that they overpaid me, and threatening to take me to court if  I don't write them a check.  GSK makes it difficult to get your paystubs, which are very difficult to understand anyway.  They forced all workers to 'go paperless' yet won't give you time or access to download a paystub! They don't properly train low level supervisors, who in turn mentally abuse the older workers until they quit...forcing them to take orders from temporary employees.  One woman who broke her hip at work and eventually came back to work about 8 months later, was quickly fired for 'not being able to lift 50 lbs.  There is a huge gap between upper management and line workers.  Young laboratory workers and office personnel are treated like gold, while most regular workers are kept out of the corporate loop.  Training via computer is about the worst I've ever seen- forcing workers to take tests in areas that don't concern their actual jobs.  Temporary workers are told they will get hired soon...but almost never do get hired on by the company (I felt sorry for them).  The company puts up a huge false front about treating people with respect, yet ignores and retaliates against employees who actually have the courage to complain about being an environment like a teacher screaming at the kindergarden kids!

Working with them is more of a collaboration than a supervisor-supervisee relationship. In fact, they are more fun and worthwhile to interact with than most peers.","Management is completely untrained, both with respect to running a research program and with respect to working with others. People are promoted into management positions based on ambition rather than ability. The more of a steamroller you are the better. 
There is no training available to scientists with respect to managing and interacting with people (and we are scientists-'nuf said), and to rely on management that also has no people skills is a mistake. I was having trouble with a report once and my 'pep talk' meeting with her was absolutely disastrous. I handled it very poorly, and could have used a little coaching.  Additionally, managers  are completely unable to run meetings, allowing some people to turn a 5 minute update into a 30 minute dissertation. That turns a 1 hour meeting into a 2 1/2 hour waste of an afternoon. 
I also wonder if there isn't a little seniority discrimination or 'problem dumping' going on.  During one of our department downsizings, I was chosen to be one of people who needed to find another position within the company. I was having some serious personal problems at the time, and was also one of the highest paid non-managers. In the nine years I had spent in that department, I had received mostly excellent reviews and several awards (including a very rarely given gold award).  Admittedly I was struggling at the time I was selected to go elsewhere, but rather than try to help me and guide me through my troubles, the director chose to dump me instead.

Canteen
The general attitude to when someone leaves or its there b'day there is a celebration.  
Charity Work is outstanding","Where do I begin:
The minute I arrived I was treated extremely inappropriately for a large organisation.  
•	There was no training at all and was thrown in the deep end literally.   
•	I was told by a team member (on the first day) that I must never speak to higher management.
•	The systems are so outdated.  They use a system called JDE from the 1970s.  For anyone unfamiliar with JDE it’s MSDOS based which means training on all the F functions is required if you want to access any menus. This is not like an intuitive windows based or WYSIWYG system which anyone with good I.T. skills will figure out. The people with the knowledge on this system will not help you.  It’s as though they want to keep you in the dark so you look incompetent by having to constantly ask for help. Be prepared to teach yourself everything. What should be a simple task takes a long time to complete. This further highlights the deplorable lack of training.
•	All processes are extremely dragged out and not efficient for a Pharmaceutical company. Completing your own work and others work can be very upsetting and frustrating at times.    
•	In the interview the job I was told I would be doing was a customer based, administration role but in reality I did work I consider it was more the function of a finance controller.
•	You want to have a good knowledge of mathematics and be an excel whiz. The outdated system meant every department just created their own excel sheets for everything.  The shared network was a nightmare to navigate and you could spend a week searching for a folder. Instead of instinctively knowing where to search as is the case in a well organised company, you would email stakeholders with a hyperlink to every file path for this reason.
•	There are too many chiefs not enough Indians.  Everyone is a manager and many of them are not held to task as their managers are U.K based.
•	 They are not open to new ideas. Most of the staff are lifers and are resistant to change. They are happy doing things inefficiently because that’s just the way it is and done in this large company. If you thrive on progress this company with kill your enthusiasm and hope.
•	Frequent sick days by a number of permanent staff who were consistently and noticeably out sick. No flexibility with certain members of management. 
•	While a good social life is important in any work environment, I found the level of fraternising inappropriate on one team. This lead to an unpleasant working environment for anyone outside of this inner circle. Bullying was rampant.   
•	A number of people left within a very short space of commencing a new job because they couldn't work in such an unprofessional and unreasonably demanding environment. 
•	Even though I was only there a short time a number of new starts were required due to restructure and I would have conducted more training of new starts than the permanent staff, many of whom had been promoted. Their cosiness with management created an air of entitlement and laziness. While I could admire ability and talent in one or two of these staff members, the culture at GSK meant bad habits were learned and passed on to the next generation of ‘leaders’.  
•	Certain members of management didn't get to know you. They would listen to tales being told out of context rather than opening their eyes to what was actually going on around them. 
•	GSK do not give out references. On leaving I was not thanked for the work I had done and a management comments parting comment to me was “I hope you learnt something” and walked away.   I would class myself open and friendly and felt this behavior was not necessary.  
There is an air of bragging about working outside normal hours and weekends and is praised by certain management and then work is lacking during the week as these people are overtired/drained.
•	Communication between teams e.g. marketing and sales is appalling and key departments should be united on their objectives for the selling cycles.
I am a consummate professional and I take pride in my work. The culture at this company does not value this and any hint of ability or progress is seen as a threat. I never had a problem getting on with colleagues previous to joining this company. If you’re a shut up and put up kind of person who likes to collect a pay cheque regardless of how unfulfilling the work is, then this place would be a great place to work. You get a global brand on your CV which will help getting your next job no doubt. If, like me, you like working and enjoy a pleasant work environment, steer well clear.

Good health insurance and retirement benefits.","The senior-level and mid-level managers who once made this company great are all gone. GSK today is a company run by fear and suboptimal managers. The previous focus on sales and marketing is gone. What drives most decisions now is fear of legal action. The lawyers essentially run the company because they so significantly impact key decisions. Marketing and Sales have little say in key decisions anymore, and R&D has turned into a joke, with very little marketing/commercial input . R&D is wrought with number fudging and reluctance to terminate assets despite poor trial results. There is a systematic effort to make it appear there is a robust pipeline, when in fact, half the assets are seriously troubled. Short-term shareholders and legal fears are what drives the decision making at GSK. In addition, the company is pennywise and pound foolish, and many operations decisions are vehemently opposed by staff, which has destroyed morale.  Outsourcing is rampant and many managers in the US now have their admin assistants located in India. Yes, seriously. The fear of layoffs is pervasive and the stress levels are high. With so many layoffs and good people jumping ship, the morale has declined over the past 5-7 years. No one smiles, no one jokes around or has fun working. Unlike years past, it is now a miserable, depressing place to work. Stock options are worthless, promotions rarely occur, and the continuing a career at GSK has lost its appeal. The most highly regarded managers have been plucked away by other companies and only the bottom of the barrel remain. So much intellectual capital has been lost. It is a shame to have witnessed a once-great company slide so far downhill.","None",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,"Tue Mar 26 2013 14:20:30 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)"
